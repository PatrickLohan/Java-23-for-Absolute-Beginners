= Errata for Java for Absolute Beginners


_Nothing here yet, hopefully it stays this way! ;)_

* "Hello World" should be "Hello, World" (Oxford comma)
* p20: mismatch build numbers
* p32: Valhalla "use memory /less/ efficiently" should be /more/
* p41: some small errors with linux terminology
* what is the com.apress.bgn.foo that keeps getting mentioned (ch03)?
* p89, line 55: space needed around equals operator
* p113: should be moving the java file not class file?
